  Gatsby blog integrated with Contentful
</h1>
<p align="center">

Hey there! This is a blog I made for an article in progress to be published on the 1st of September 2019 titled "Gatsby+Contentful = Smarter content management". The article explains how to build this blog using **Gatsby** and **Contentful** (CMS) so that everytime you want to add an articl to id, **you wont have to add a single line of code to your codebase**. [Check it out!](https://anssamblog.netlify.com) and let me know what you think :D

## Why?
Say you want to build a blog, or a personal portfolio. Your blog will contain the articles that you continuously publish.Â 

This means that every time you want to add a new article to your blog, you have to get your hands dirty again with the code base. This kind of project is different from the others, since it's a project that never ends, as you have to constantly update it with your newest publicationsâ€¦Â 

_**Is there a better way to manage the content of your blog without having to code everyÂ time?**_

**Content Management Systems** (CMS) seemed like the right answer to this question. "Gatsby+Contentful = Smarter content management" will help you, a reader who has a blog or a portfolio or any kind of website, to maintain your app in a smart and easy way forever ðŸ¤“

The article explains how to integrate Contentful, a CMS with a blog built with Gatsby, a fast framework based on React. The blog also uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) to manage the data flow within in.
